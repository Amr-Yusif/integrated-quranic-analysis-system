# Integrated Quranic Analysis and Exploration System (IQAES)

## Stage 4 Development Guide

This guide outlines the development process for Stage 4 of the IQAES project, focusing on systematic exploration and integration.

### Project Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Development Rules

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Run tests before committing changes

#### Code Quality
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Document all public APIs and functions

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- All commits must pass automated tests
- Code review required for all PRs
- Automated deployment for main branch

### Stage 4 Components

1. Exploration Mechanisms
   - Pattern Discovery
   - Active Learning
   - Interactive Exploration

2. Relationship Networks
   - Concept Relationships
   - Knowledge Graphs
   - Semantic Networks

3. Analysis Accuracy
   - Multi-level Verification
   - Precision Evaluation
   - Quality Metrics

4. Knowledge Integration
   - Source Integration
   - Conflict Resolution
   - Knowledge Merging

5. Lexicon Expansion
   - ML-based word extraction and analysis
   - Automatic linguistic feature generation
   - Batch processing of source texts
   - Advanced lexical features integration

### Lexicon Expansion Tools

The project now includes tools for expanding the Arabic lexicon using machine learning:

1. CLI for lexicon expansion:
   ```bash
   # Extract words from a text file
   npm run lexicon extract-words -f path/to/text.txt -o output.txt

   # Expand lexicon with new entries from text
   npm run lexicon expand -f path/to/text.txt -c 20

   # Enhance existing entries with additional features
   npm run lexicon enhance

   # Batch expand from multiple files
   npm run lexicon batch-expand -d path/to/texts -p "*.txt"
   ```

2. API Endpoints:
   - `GET /api/lexicon/stats` - Get lexicon statistics
   - `GET /api/lexicon/search?q=word` - Search the lexicon
   - `GET /api/lexicon/entry/:id` - Get entry by ID
   - `GET /api/lexicon/word/:word` - Get entry by word
   - `POST /api/lexicon/expand` - Expand lexicon with ML

### Contributing

1. Create a feature branch from develop
2. Follow TDD principles
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Submit PR for review

### Quality Metrics

- Test Coverage: > 90%
- Code Quality: A grade
- Documentation: Complete
- Performance: < 100ms response
