# Integrated Quranic Analysis and Exploration System (IQAES)

## Stage 4 Development Guide

This guide outlines the development process for Stage 4 of the IQAES project, focusing on systematic exploration and integration.

### Project Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Development Rules

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Run tests before committing changes

#### Code Quality
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Document all public APIs and functions

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- All commits must pass automated tests
- Code review required for all PRs
- Automated deployment for main branch
